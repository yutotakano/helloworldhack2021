## About

Remove tiles by construct valid equations!

Inspired by Bejeweled and Candy Crush, our game is an addicting proof-of-concept that attempts to integrate maths with fun.

Underneath the beautiful sprites and satisfying sounds hide the unexpected difficulty in constructing equations, rendering this game an entertaining but certainly challenging game for even adults.

## How to play

Swap two tiles by dragging one over another. The move is nullified if it doesn't immediately create an equation.

Equations can be constructed from three blocks (`1 = 1`) or with five (`1 + 2 = 3`, `2 = 4 - 2`), in either horizontal or vertical directions. When a valid equation is formed, the tiles will disappear, the ones above will fall down, and new ones will be spwaned filling the top.

## Runnning

Requirements:
- Python >= 3.8
- pygame (`pip install pygame`)

Steps:
1. Clone this repository, or download it as ZIP
2. cd into the main folder, and execute `python main.py`.
